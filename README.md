My journey began in the world of graphic design, where I first encountered front-end developers. Since then, I've been blending my experience with honing my skills as a developer.

On the front-end, I have a solid command of semantic HTML, allowing me to create web structures optimized for SEO and accessibility. I utilize libraries like Tailwind CSS and Material UI to craft responsive interfaces.

In the React universe, I build scalable applications, leveraging libraries such as React Router for routing management and Context for state management. I excel in event handling and API interaction, delivering dynamic user experiences.

On the server-side, I'm proficient in Node.js and have experience with relational and non-relational databases, including MySQL and MongoDB. Recently, I've delved into Next.js, exploring its capabilities and integrating TypeScript for safer code, as well as developing full-stack applications, providing comprehensive solutions for various projects.

Currently, my primary development stack is MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js), where I have a solid command. With this stack, I develop modern web applications, from server setup to building responsive UIs.

My journey extends beyond web developmentâ€”I also have basic knowledge in mobile development with React Native. Additionally, I have previous experience with the WordPress platform, enabling me to offer integrated and versatile solutions for different development needs.

I'm also fluent in English, enabling effective communication in a global context. I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to expand my knowledge and enhance my skills.
