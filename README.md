My journey began in graphic design, where I had my first contact with front-end developers. Since then, I have been combining my experience with my improvement as a developer.

On the front-end, I have a solid command of semantic HTML, allowing me to create web structures optimized for SEO and accessibility. I use libraries like Tailwind CSS, Material UI, and StyledComponents to style responsive interfaces.

With React.js, I develop applications using libraries like React Router for routing management, Context for state management, and Axios for HTTP requests and API interactions.

On the back-end, I am proficient in Node.js and Java with Spring Boot, and I have experience with relational and non-relational databases, such as PostgreSQL and MongoDB. Recently, I have been delving into Next.js, exploring its capabilities, and integrating TypeScript for safer code.

Currently, I develop full-stack applications using Java Spring Boot, React, and PostgreSQL as my main stack, but I am also comfortable using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) pattern or its variation with Vue.js, in which I have good knowledge.

My journey is not limited to web development - I also have basic knowledge in mobile development with React Native. Additionally, I have previous experience with the WordPress platform and plugins like Elementor and Woocommerce, which allows me to offer solutions for different development needs.

I am also fluent in English, allowing me to communicate effectively in a global context, and I have an intermediate level in French. I am always seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and improve my skills.
